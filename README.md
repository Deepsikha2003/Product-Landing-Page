# Product-Landing-Page

This is a modern, visually appealing, and responsive product landing page designed to showcase a curated collection of specialty coffee beverages. The website highlights product visuals, descriptions, and clean interface elements to provide an elegant digital storefront experience for a cafe or beverage brand.

## Technologies Used

The website is built using the following foundational web technologies:

- **HTML5**: Used to structure the content and layout of the landing and product pages in a semantic and accessible manner.
- **CSS3**: Responsible for styling, layout design, responsive behavior, and visual aesthetics across all devices.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Powers the dynamic loading of product data, image transitions, and page interactivity.

## External Libraries & Resources

To enhance the visual quality and functionality of the site, several external resources have been incorporated:

- **Google Fonts**:
  - **Playfair Display**: Used for main titles and headings, giving the interface a refined and artisanal tone.
  - **Roboto**: Applied to body text for a clean, modern, and readable experience.

- **Font Awesome**:
  - Utilized for social media icons and interface enhancements in the footer or navigation (if included in future versions).

- **Placeholder Images**:
  - Currently, all product and hero images are placeholders. These should be replaced with high-quality photos of real coffee products for production or live deployment.

## Website Structure

The project is structured in a modular and organized format:
